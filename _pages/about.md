<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD candidate student in College of Intelligence and Computing in Tianjin University, supervised by Prof. [Longbiao Wang](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/wanglongbiao/wang.html) and Prof. [Jianwu Dang](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~jdang/index-e.htm). My research topic is Speech Separation Based on Deep Learning in Open Complex Environment. During my PhD period, I also worked as a research assistant in NTU and NUS in Singapore from 2019 to 2022, supervised by Prof. [Eng Siong Chng](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/aseschng/default.html) and Prof. [Haizhou Li](https://colips.org/~eleliha/). Prior to that, I received my Master‚Äôs Degree from Tianjin University under the supervision of Prof. [Di Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Q8MRRecAAAAJ) and Prof. [Liang Yang](https://yangliang.github.io/) in 2017, and my master's research topic is Socical Network or Community Detection.

My research interest includes speech processing, speech separation and social network analysis. I have published more than 10 papers at the top international AI conferences such as IJCAI, ICASSP, INTERSPEECH.
